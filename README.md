# EDA on Global Warming

## 1. Carbon Emision per pereson -:
### 1.a. What I do:
..* Calculates CO₂ emissions per person for each country.
..* Analyzes emissions trends in countries like India, Turkey, and Brazil.
..* Looks at data from the year 1900 onward.
..* Observes changes in emissions per person, especially in economically transitioning countries.
### 1.b.Conclusion
..* CO₂ emissions per person have varied significantly across countries, with developing nations showing noticeable trends as they undergo economic growth.
### 1.c.what we can do next (by using conclusion)
..* Study how emissions change over time.
..* Compare emissions between developed and developing countries.
..* Predict future emissions based on past trends.

## 2. Carbon Emision per Area(km2) -:
### 1.a. What I do:
..* Calculates CO₂ emissions per square kilometer for each country.
..* Analyzes trends for countries like India, Russia, and the U.S., comparing them with the world average.
..* Plots CO₂ emissions over time for both the world average and specific countries.
### 1.b.Conclusion:
..* India emits more CO₂ per square kilometer than the world average.
..* CO₂ emissions are not directly dependent on the country’s area.
### 1.c.what we can do next (by using conclusion)
..* Compare emissions per area with other factors like population density.
..* Study policies or factors influencing high emissions in specific countries.

## 3. Temprature(World)
### 1.a. What I do:
..*  Uses average temperature data by country and year.
..* Calculates the world’s average temperature over the years and tracks the change from the initial recorded value.
..*  Plots temperature changes over time to observe trends.
### 1.b.Conclusion:
..* The world’s average temperature has shown variations over the years, with noticeable changes compared to the baseline year.
### 1.c.what we can do next (by using conclusion)
..* Compare temperature changes with CO₂ emissions data.
..* Investigate regional differences in temperature trends and their potential causes. ​

## 4.Sea Level(GMSL)
### 1.a. What I do:
..* Study global sea level trends and their link to carbon emissions.
..* Plot graph and try to find patterns in sea level and emissions.
### 1.b.Conclusion:
..* Rate of increase in the sea level is the directly propertion to the carbon emision.
### 1.c.what we can do next (by using conclusion):
..* Build models to predict future sea levels based on emissions.

## 4. Study on One country(CHINA)
### 1.a. What I do:
..* Study CHINA GDP trends and their link to carbon emissions.
..* Plot graph and try to find patterns in CHINA GDP and emissions.
### 1.b.Conclusion:
..* Rate of increase in the CHINA GDP is the directly propertion to the carbon emision.
### 1.c.what we can do next (by using conclusion):
..* Build models to predict future emissions based on GDP.
..* To control the carbon emision we can forced the devlop country to decrease the carbon emision.
